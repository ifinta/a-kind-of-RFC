# a-kind-of-RFC
An RFC for Charm, for a kind of Money, but backed through a P2P network of "Cells" - a type of "central"bank, but it should be decentralised.

We published everything as free (github nolicence - you have all rights and we have no demand) but
if you can talk about our performance, a link, or a (copyleft) notice, or something other support for us - many thanks - it helps us - and
we helped you - we think it is the base of an anonym P2P jurisdiction (( (copyright maybe) Dumas ).
