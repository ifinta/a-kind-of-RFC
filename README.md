# a-kind-of-RFC
An RFC for Charm, for a kind of Money, but backed through a P2P network of "Cells" - a type of "central"bank, but it should be decentralised.

Some information from my post on bitcointalk.org:

"
Many thanks for your support in our big performance ( since greencoin was published... it will be continoue later - be patient -
this is only an (greencoin was the first maybe) episope Smiley ).

About the casting please see below our performers Smiley

The Open Ledger for Charm, for a decentralised P2P "central"bank, will be developed of course fort. Vortexledger also - I hope.
The performance was a kind of publicity and sometimes also a need!

But some remark. We published everything (up to the algo) as free (github nolicence - do have all rights and we have no demand) but
if you can talk about our performance, a link, or a (copyleft) notice, or something other support for us - many thanks - it helps us - and
we helped you - we think it is the base of an anonym P2P jurisdiction (( (copyright maybe) Dumas).

Charm is a personal use open ledger at this time with a tokenized emerald for a person and the environment of this person. A personal money.
It has a personal (centralised) central bank. It is backed with a value - you and your environment should be know - what they would like to use.
It is possible to use i.e. working hours, or water, ...

I started to define an algo for tokenize thing (1 ounce silver coins), earlyer as I could define it in written form in VÃ¡c in December 2016.
Befor I forget everything...... Sad Remember December 3rd 2016. ...... Remember December 2011 in Salzburg......
The algo was published in curtly.club between some members on our first homepage. I developed this algo fort - up to the needed algo
(not published yet) for Vortexledger. For the Ledger to support barter.

The algo for a decentralized "central"bank is only 5-6 pages (exists already) only, with the know-how how to work a such personal "central"bank.

Many thanks for the attention."
